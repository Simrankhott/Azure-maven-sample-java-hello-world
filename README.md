branches: This section specifies the branches to include in the pipeline. In this case, it includes only the master branch.

pool: This section specifies the name of the agent pool where the pipeline will run. The name field is set to simran, indicating that the pipeline will use an agent pool named "myagent".

steps: This section contains the steps that will be executed as part of the pipeline.

The first step is a script step that updates the package lists and installs Java Development Kit (JDK) and Maven using apt-get commands.

The second step is another script step that runs the mvn clean test command to build and test the project using Maven.

The third step uses the PublishPipelineArtifact task to publish an artifact named "myartifact". It specifies the target path where the artifact will be stored, which is the target directory under the Jenkins build workspace.

The fourth step uses the DownloadPipelineArtifact task to download the previously published artifact "myartifact" to the specified path on the agent machine, /home/ubuntu/myartifact.
